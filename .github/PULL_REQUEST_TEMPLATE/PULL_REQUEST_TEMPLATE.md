## About this PR

## Checklist

1. Scan your source code for useless code, comments, etc.

2. Assess whether methods and classes follow single use/responsibility.

3. There is almost always, no need for duplicated code.

4. Strive to be concise, write readable code with code style in mind.

5. Dense or complicated code is documented. Teach it to yourself.

6. Exceptions are handled and communicated properly (catch block, throw exception, descriptive logs)

7. Justify if a class/method is as many LOC (lines of code) as it needs to be.

8. Gauge the validity of your types, use dynamic/complex types as needed.

9. Scope of access should be as restrictive as possible.

10. Follow OOP, break big problems into smaller, simpler ones. Design methods/classes with this in mind.

You are the last line of defense.

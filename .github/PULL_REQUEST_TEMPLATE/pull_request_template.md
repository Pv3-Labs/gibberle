When reviewing this pull request, please go through and inspect your peers code. You are the last line of defense.

1. Scan your source code for useless code, comments, etc.

2. Assess whether methods and classes follow single use/responsibility.

3. There is almost always, no need for duplicated code.

4. Strive to be concise, write readable code with code style in mind.

5. Dense or complicated code is documented. Teach it to yourself.

6. Use of types and operations should be consistent. Validate why.

7. Unmanaged resources are properly handled (e.g. for every malloc comes a free)

8.  Exceptions are handled and communicated properly (catch block, throw exception, descriptive logs)

9.  Justify if a class/method is as many LOC as it needs to be.

10. Sparingly use nested loops / branches, only when needed.

11. Verify that tests are carrying out their purpose and properly cover their subject

12. Gauge the validity of your types, use dynamic/complex types as needed.

13. Scope of access should be as restrictive as possible.

14. Follow OOP, break big problems into smaller, simpler ones. Design methods/classes with this in mind.

15. Remove redundant inefficiencies / type casts / conversions

16. Recall the design guidelines (is the code compliant?)

You are the last line of defense.
